# Desktop-Assistant
This project is my Minor project

In today’s era almost all tasks are digitalized. We have Smartphone in hands and it is nothing less

 than having world at your fingertips. These days we aren’t even using fingers. We just speak of the

 task and it is done. There exist systems where we can say Text Dad, “I’ll be late today.” And the
 
text is sent. That is the task of a Virtual Assistant. It also supports specialized task such as booking a

 flight, or finding cheapest book online from various ecommerce sites and then providing an
 
interface to book an order are helping automate search, discovery and online order operations.
 
Virtual Assistants are software programs that help you ease your day to day tasks, such as showing
 
weather report, creating reminders, making shopping lists etc.

This system is designed to be used efficiently on desktops Personal assistant software improves user

 productivity by managing routine tasks of the user and by providing information from online 

sources to the user. This project was started on the premise that there is sufficient amount of openly 

available data and information on the web that can be utilized to build a virtual assistant that has 

access to making intelligent decisions for routine user activities.
